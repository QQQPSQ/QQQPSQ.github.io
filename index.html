<h1>Android Phone App QQQPSQ</h1>
<p>This app was created using Android Studio 2.1.1
The suppy of money is inelastice based on the increase / decrease of Central Banker's decisions.
Prices are elastice based on supply / demand of the needs and perceptions of the traders.
This is reflected in the quantity purchasers can buy until they run out of money.
For example, if a stock price is low, purchasers can buy a larger number of shares at a time.
Conversely, if a stock price is high, purchasers can only buy a smaller number of shares at a time.
This share per trade volume indicates if purchasers are running low on cash and the stock price should decline.
Large share purchases indicate purchasers have excess cash and the price should increase.
This app has guidelines indicating the price per share volume ratio to the money supply.
You can modify the app to observe your stock share size guidelines and your broker to place trades.
QQQ and PSQ are used to indicate methods of trading long and short.
